# Keras-Tensorflow-Cifar10-Model

First time using tensorflow and keras, comments in the notebook file.

My attempt at image recognition learning using 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers with some extra preprocessing.

Final score: loss: 0.6293 - acc: 0.7742 - val_loss: 0.9723 - val_acc: 0.7024
